## üìà Usage

The app has (at the moment) two options for imputing the values. In the simplest terms, you just give your data as a csv, select the preferred options and let the app fill the missing values.

* <strong>Input your data</strong>: The app read the data and suggests the columntypes for you.
* <strong>Confirm the selected column types</strong>: This is important as classifying a numeric feature wont work.
* <strong>Select model</strong>: Simple models are much faster but can be less accurate. Complex models can be too slow and result in a timeout. All depends on the size and complexity of your data. With over 10k rows the XGBoost imputer will probably not work (and I have no patience to wait for hours.)
* <strong>Impute</strong>: Impute the values with the chosen model and settings.
* <strong>Check validation metrics</strong>: These metrics give a rough estimate how well the imputed values match the data.
Once you are satisfied, you can to download the imputed dataset.
